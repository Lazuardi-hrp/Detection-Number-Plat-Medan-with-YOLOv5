# Detection Number Plat Medan with YOLOv5
This research creates a vehicle license plate character detection system to facilitate the authorities in supervising vehicle users. This system aims to change the traditional way of recording evidence of manual traffic violations by automating the computation of vehicle numbers. The Indonesian license plate recognition system consists of two processes: detecting plate objects and recognizing number digits. Plate character detection uses the YOLOv5 method. The use of YOLOv5 in this research is because this method is an effective object detection method. The accuracy results obtained are 94.5% for localization and 67.1% for vehicle number plate detection for character classification on vehicle plates.
